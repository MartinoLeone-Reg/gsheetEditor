# GWT-Generator 
## Purpose
This is a Google Script designed to scan google sheets where a stored some GWT instructions and from this file, the script will generate a file with a test for every case scenario which we have written this test, the user will be also able to choose the language which he wants to use and the script will immediately generate it.
Then we want to make things harder and we want to update the gsheet file when we execute the tests updating the project when we run the tests and write the results and for doing this we are going to need to use the Google Api and we are going to implement the connection with the differents langueges implemented

## Update Implementation

First of all we are going to need to do some things which are the same regardless the languages:
1. Open the same project which we have created previously and click on the "share" button

let's take  look at the Server folder and open 2 cmd console, from the server directory let's run the following  line:
```nodeJS
npm start
```
and we should see this on screen:

At this moment we just need to generate the file from the sheet and run it üåü
